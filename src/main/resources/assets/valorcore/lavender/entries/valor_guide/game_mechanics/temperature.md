The environment of Valor is harsh, and not for the faint of heart. You will need to keep cool when it is hot, and warm when it is freezing.

---

There are multiple ways to **keep cool** when it is hot.

1. Take off your armor.
2. Equip the Wanderer Armor.

<recipe;environmentz:wanderer_helmet>

<recipe;environmentz:wanderer_chestplate>

;;;;;

<recipe;environmentz:wanderer_leggings>

<recipe;environmentz:wanderer_boots>

3. Drink lots of liquids.
4. Cool off in a body of water.

;;;;;

5. Craft an ice pack.

<recipe;environmentz:ice_pack>

;;;;;

There are also multiple ways to **keep warm** when it is freezing.

1. Keep near sources of heat.
2. Craft %{item.environmentz.heating_stones}%.

<recipe;environmentz:heating_stones>

Heat the %{item.environmentz.heating_stones}%, then carry them on your person to keep warm.

;;;;;

3. Equip the Wolf or Leather armor.

<recipe;environmentz:wolf_helmet>

<recipe;environmentz:wolf_chestplate>

;;;;;

<recipe;environmentz:wolf_leggings>

<recipe;environmentz:wolf_boots>

;;;;;

4. Insulate your armor using %{item.environmentz.polar_bear_fur}% or %{item.adventurez.mammoth_fur}% in an %{block.minecraft.anvil}%.
